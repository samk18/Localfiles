Hello Andrea,

Hope you are doing well.
 I wanted to reach out regarding potential job opportunities at Nexer. Previously, I was hired for a position as a C++ developer at Nexer, but unfortunately, I couldn't join at that time due to some reasons.

I am currently working at Ericsson Gothenburg as a Senior developer and exploring new career opportunities and wanted to reach out to see if you have any open positions at your company that align with my skills and previous experience?
Looking forward to your reply

Thanks,
Best regards
