ETSI Global Configuration

(An idea: add Pois in LiPoi to avoid double deliveries)

Update handleOpen event to harvest for pois {PgwCreateSessionS5 PgwCreateDedicatedBearers} if PGW Standalone
Implement handleUpdateEvent(event, poi) to harvest for pois {PgwUpdateServingNodeInitiatedS5} if PGW standalone
Implement handleCloseEvent to harvest for pois {PgwDeleteInternal, PgwDeleteInternalDedicatedBearer, PgwDeleteServingNodeInitiatedS5S2Gtp, PgwDeleteBearerCommand} if PGW standalone
Implement an overloaded Harvest function for start of interception
Implement start of interception poi {PgwStartOfInterceptionWithActiveBearer} if Standalone

IRI Building
- Generate ASN1 code (the shellscript)
- Build X2 message for
                Bearer Activation
                                PgwCreateSessionS5
                                PgwCreateDedicatedBearers
                                PgwStartOfInterceptionWithActiveBearer
                Bearer Modification
                                PgwUpdateServingNodeInitiatedS5,
                Bearer Deactivation
                                PgwDeleteInternal,
                                PgwDeleteInternalDedicatedBearer,

1.            Verify that ETSI X1, X2 configuration is excluded with the configuration of li-oam: epg node feature-activation li-oam
2.            Verify Bearer Activation/Deactivation IRI is sent correctly by PGW-C for each default/dedicated bearer via ETSI LI X2 interface (TargetIdentifier = IMSI). 
3.            Verify Bearer Deactivation IRI is sent correctly by PGW-C for each default/dedicated bearer via ETSI LI X2 interface when deleting default bearer (TargetIdentifier = MSISDN).
4.            Verify Start of Interception with Bearer Active/Deactivation IRI is sent correctly by PGW-C for each default/dedicated bearer via ETSI LI X2 interface (TargetIdentifier = IMEI). 
5.            Verify Bearer Modification IRI is sent correctly for default and each dedicated bearer by PGW-C via ETSI LI X2 interface when RAT/ECI is changed (without SGW change).
