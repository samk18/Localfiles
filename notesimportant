It seems like you want to pass a value to the constructor of class `A` through the constructor of class `B`. In your current code, class `B` contains an instance of class `A`, and you want to initialize it with a value. However, there is a small issue in your code that needs to be addressed.

Here's a corrected version of your code:

```cpp
class A {
public:
    int h;
    
    A(int x) {
        h = x;
    }
};

class B {
public:
    A k;
    static B obj1;

    B(int x) : k(x) {
        // Constructor of B takes an integer value 'x'
        // and initializes the member 'k' of class A with 'x'
    }
};

int main() {
    B myB(42); // Create an instance of class B with value 42
    return 0;
}
```

In this corrected code, I added a constructor to class `B` that takes an integer argument `x`. Inside this constructor, the member `k` of class `A` is initialized using the value of `x`.

When you create an instance of class `B`, you provide an integer value as an argument to the constructor of `B`. This value is then used to initialize the member `k` of class `A`.

Keep in mind that the relationship between class `A` and class `B` might need further refinement based on your specific requirements.
